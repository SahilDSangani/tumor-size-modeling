# Tumor Size Prediction and Lifestyle Impact Modeling in R

This project explores how lifestyle and demographic factors‚Äîsuch as physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and living environment‚Äîaffect tumor size. Using R, the analysis fits multiple linear models and two-way ANOVAs to evaluate both individual and interaction effects of these variables.  

The R Markdown file (`Midterm.Rmd`) is **templatized**, allowing you to easily swap in new datasets or variable names to generate fresh analyses and visualizations with minimal code changes.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Goal:** Identify which behavioral changes most strongly reduce tumor size risk.
- **Methods:**  
  - Two-way ANOVA to analyze main and interaction effects.  
  - Linear regression modeling to quantify variable importance.  
  - Scenario-based prediction to simulate how lifestyle changes impact expected tumor size.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Interaction plots and boxplots to visualize categorical relationships.  
  - Scenario-based prediction charts for interpretability.

## üß† Scenario Example

A hypothetical case study is presented for **Joe**, a 40-year-old male, to demonstrate the model‚Äôs predictive power.  
By holding all other variables constant, the analysis simulates how individual lifestyle changes‚Äîsuch as quitting smoking or increasing physical activity‚Äîaffect predicted tumor size.  
The model shows that quitting smoking yields the largest reduction in expected tumor size, highlighting the importance of behavioral interventions.
