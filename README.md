# Tumor Size Prediction and Lifestyle Impact Modeling in R

This project analyzes how lifestyle and demographic factors‚Äîsuch as physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking history, and living environment‚Äîaffect tumor size.  
It uses two-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression to explore both individual and interaction effects of these variables.  

The report is written in a **templatized R Markdown framework**, allowing users to easily replace variable names or datasets to quickly produce new analyses and visualizations.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Investigate how lifestyle factors influence tumor size (in mm).  
- Test for main and interaction effects using **two-way ANOVA**.  
- Fit and evaluate **linear regression models** for prediction.  
- Simulate lifestyle changes through **scenario-based modeling**.  
- Provide reusable, **templatized code** for quick reanalysis.

## üß† Scenario Example

A hypothetical case study (‚ÄúJoe‚Äù) illustrates how changes in one behavior‚Äîsuch as quitting smoking or increasing physical activity‚Äîaffect predicted tumor size while keeping other factors constant.  
The model shows that quitting smoking results in the **largest decrease** in expected tumor size, emphasizing the importance of behavioral factors in health outcomes.
